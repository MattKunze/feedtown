# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Feedtown

## Project Context
This is a Rust workspace project called "feedtown" using Cargo workspaces for modular development. The project follows modern Rust best practices with Axum for HTTP APIs.

## Code Style and Conventions
- Use standard Rust formatting (cargo fmt)
- Prefer explicit error handling with Result types
- Use structured logging with the tracing crate
- Follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for types)
- Write descriptive comments for public APIs

## Architecture Patterns
- Workspace-based modular architecture
- Dependency injection with trait abstractions
- Axum for HTTP API development
- Tower middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- JSON serialization with serde

## Key Dependencies
- axum: Web framework
- tokio: Async runtime
- tower/tower-http: Middleware
- tracing: Structured logging
- serde: Serialization

## Common Patterns
- State management with Axum extractors
- Error handling with custom error types
- Middleware for logging, CORS, authentication
- Health check endpoints
- JSON request/response handling

## File Organization
- api/src/main.rs: Main API server
- Workspace dependencies in root Cargo.toml
- Each crate has focused responsibility

## When suggesting code:
- Use workspace dependencies when possible
- Include proper error handling
- Add appropriate logging statements
- Follow async/await patterns with tokio
- Use Axum's extractors and response types
- Include proper HTTP status codes
